# The-Chore-Organizer

The Chore Organizer is a simple Python Flask web application that allows you and your roommate to keep track of chores, tasks, and other things everybody needs to do to maintain a clean and happy living space. Your apartments are stored as documents in a MongoDB database, hosted on mLab.

## How to use

First, you will want to create your apartment. There, follow the instructions and fill in the information needed. You'll list out all the tasks for your apartment and assign a roommate to each.

Next, any one of your roommates and look up your apartment and check off which tasks they have finished. When a task is finished, the following roommate will be automatically assigned. 

## Where can I find it? 

The application is hosted on Heroku and can be found at [https://the-chore-organizer.herokuapp.com](https://the-chore-organizer.herokuapp.com).

This was a small side project I created for me to be able to practice using Flask and MongoDB as well as to dip my feet into learning and using a new CSS framework, W3.
